Project Overview
This Python project focuses on input and output operations, particularly file handling and JSON serialization/deserialization. The tasks are designed to strengthen understanding of core Python concepts and best practices.

Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you should be able to:

Understand the importance of Python programming.
Perform various file operations including reading, writing, and appending.
Manipulate file cursors and ensure proper file closure.
Utilize the with statement for efficient file handling.
Grasp the concepts of JSON, serialization, and deserialization.
Convert Python data structures to JSON strings and vice versa.

Requirements
Python Scripts
Editors: Use vi, vim, or emacs.
Interpretation/Compilation: The scripts must run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
File Endings: Ensure all files end with a new line.
Shebang Line: Begin all files with #!/usr/bin/python3.
README: Include a README.md file at the root of the project folder.
Code Style: Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines (pycodestyle version 2.8.*).
Executable Files: All files should be executable.
File Length: Be mindful of file length; use wc to test.
Documentation: Provide documentation for all modules, classes, and functions.
Python Test Cases
File Endings: Test files should end with a new line.
Test Folder: Place test files inside a folder named tests.
Execution: Execute all tests using python3 -m doctest ./tests/*.
